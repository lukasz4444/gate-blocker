# Hi i just wanted to tell that:
this is a fork of gate-blockeing sytem by  MR-Spagetty 

https://github.com/MR-Spagetty/gate-blocking-system

but it uses only saved address and does not require dhd.

To install just do wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukasz4444/gate-blocker/main/blocker.lua
